Part 1

1. git branch (name)

2. Fast-Forward Merge - happens when a new branch is being directly added to current branch (linear path) / Recursive Merge - happens when branches have diverged and new commits have been added to both branches

3. git checkout (name)

4. git branch -d

5. When Git cant decide what file to merge due to different commits being added to the same file


Part 2

git branch main-1

git checkout main-1

git branch new-branch-1

git checkout new-branch-1

echo "changes" >> newfile1.txt

git add newfile1.txt

git commit -m "added newfile1.txt"

git checkout main-1

git merge new-branch-1


git checkout -b new-branch-2

echo "changes new-branch-2" >> newfile1.txt

git add newfile1.txt

git commit -m "changed newfile1.txt on new-branch-2"

git chechout main-1

echo "changes main-1" >> newfile1.txt

git add newfile1.txt

git commit -m "correct newfile1 for main-1"

git merge new-branch-2

git add newfile1.txt

git commit -m "solved merge with main-1 and new-branch-2"
